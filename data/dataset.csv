UgzIMr4MU6dZ_zi5DhZ4AaABAg,"So excited to be learning about economics!! I recently switched my major from computer science & engineering to city & regional planning, so I will be taking principles of microeconomics. I never took econ in high school, so this course is helping me feel prepared and ready to tackle micro! (I would otherwise be nervous because my professor does not have the best reviews.) However, being able to understand macroeconomics through this course will certainly be helpful in my life and career even if it’s not a required course for my major!! So excited to be diving into planning :)",B43YEW2FvDs

UgwYVUP4d0xTvvePqZZ4AaABAg,"What I keep noticing is that free market economies are excellent at creating rapid economic growth, but economies that are more socialized are better at closing the socioeconomic divide. What if we started planning economies that are mostly free markets during times of economic instability, but more socialized during times of prosperity gained by capitalism? That way, we would experience necessary economic booms during times of crisis, and we would radically reduce poverty once our economy reaches a safe zone. And if we need more economic growth afterward, reduce government intervention temporarily and do the cycle again. Why don’t we make this about the long-term benefits we could give to the overall economy as well as people in need? How about we make laws that account for these time-dependent nuances?",B43YEW2FvDs

For example, a country for a relatively high capital to labor ration due to oil reserves inside of it might benefir from more governement control, beceause there is less of a need of free market allocation of resources (theres only one important one, which is already allocated by the governemnt in other countries) a country with a high labor to capital ration might need more ¨free market¨ and ¨private enterprises¨ to optimize its capital and be more productive per person.

UgwSCRnNd_-wzzX52MB4AaABAg,"Terrible definition of what is Socialism and what is Capitalism. 

Socialism is not = ""more State"" 

And Capitalism is not = ""less State"". 

Socialism means = more PUBLIC ownership of property (than private), but nobody ever said that it has to be necessarily centralized (could very well be decentralized), even less so in the Government. For example, you can research Participative Economics, Cooperative Enterprises, Consumers Cooperatives, Guild Socialism, and the whole work of guys like Oskar Lange, Paul Cockshott, and Pat Devine.

Also, just like Communism, complete Laissez Faire economies never existed anywhere in the world in history. Because there can't be private property in large scale for a long period of time without some kind of authority to secure it, like Legislative power, Judiciary power, Military, Police, etc, whatever (which kind of explains the transition from Feudalism to Capitalism om history). 
In other words, Capitalism doesn't mean just ""market economy"", but that in that market, the big majority of property is PRIVATE.",B43YEW2FvDs

The Government does not tax us in order to get the money to spend. We need to get the money from the Government in order to pay our taxes. 



The fact that mainstream economists have such an obvious fact backwards explains why they completely missed 2008 coming, and why they can't explain anything about the modern economy (unless it's after the fact, of course).

Ugx1r6c2B3dTDitREzV4AaABAg,"1) As a social order, we have to figure out three things:
 - What will we produce?
 - How to produce it?
 - Who will get it?
2) Two different economic systems: market economies and planned economies.
 a. In planned economy, government controls labor, land and capital.
 b. Communism is primarily defined by the lack of private property. Class-lessness is a symptom of having no private property. There are no communist countries in the world.
 c. Often socialism has some private property and some public ownership.
 d. Command economy is totally controlled by government.
 f. In market economies, individuals control production to get profit.
Invisible hand - the unintended social benefits resulting from individual actions.
""It's not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker, that we expect our dinner, but from the regard to their own interest.""
The mechanism of the invisible hand is that if you produce unwanted or shoddy products, a competitor will produce better more desirable products and put you out of business. This results in businesses that produce the things that people want/demand most, at lower prices.
3) Modern economies are neither completely free market nor planned. There's a spectrum of government involvement.
4) Circular flow model.
 a. Modern economy is made above households (individuals like him and you) and businesses.
 b. Businesses sell goods and services to households in product market.
 c. Households earn the money by selling labor to businesses.
 d. Businesses pay for the resources on resource market.
 f. Government also buys products and resources, i.e. to buy cars from businesses and hire policemen to drive them.
 e. Government gets the money from taxes, households and businesses (and borrowing).",B43YEW2FvDs

If you're going by the definitions, yes communism is a classless society, but it does not have a government directing people what to do. Meanwhile Socialism does and it's supposed to be a transitory period between capitalism and communism.

Much of what is bought was never though to be needed and much more is bought to replace something that doesn't need replacement. Maybe private capitalism is just good at creating consumable goods that are not needed, and state capitalism is good at creating the necessities. You don't say this of course, your question was, can a government t be flexible to demands and can it be efficient in production? The implication is no but the reality is yes. The USSR, China, Cuba, and very efficient in production each country having gone from rags to modernization very quickly and having very efficient systems in many respects. Not only do you straw man socialism, but you can't even make a good argument against it's straw man.

Stalin pretended that was not the case and dubbed it socialism. socialism and communism were largely interchangeable as I understand it, until Lenin when the revolutionaries wanted to distance themselves from other socialists who would rather obtain power through elections instead of through violent revolution. This, along with Stalin's declaration of State-Capitalism as socialism is why you believe communism is public ownership and socialism is state ownership. if you want to make that declaration then we also have to talk about libertarian socialists (anarcho-socialists) who further distanced themselves by saying their socialism is stateless (which if you're paying attention is redundant unless you consider Stalin to be correct).",B43YEW2FvDs

UgxzPfCl-i0ZPXowN7p4AaABAg,"I'm cool with the half market and half government way buuttt in our third world country the government is the most inefficient, inactive and is corrupted by politicians. As one of its countrymen i just wanna strip away some power from the senate and enact the same college voting system as US. You know the part where the random majority doesnt matter but is instead organized in ethnic provinces who are in favor of Mr./Mrs. Red or Mr./Mrs. Blue to be president or just to be part of the legislative body. This way provinces wont get ignored instead of only focusing development in the capital city. Development needs to be spread out. I also want to strip away the rights to vote of the population involved in tax evasion, squatters and anyone who breaks the law.
Our government is so weak that it cant even take initiative. People could stop paying taxes or,  build and reside on abandoned railway stations without paying a single tax in their life. This way we could truly achieved the so called intellectual democracy socrates once described.
I also want the government to be able the regulate media as it is a major part of our lives.... not completely but just a corporation between the two bodies. I wanna avoid the same biased informarion  liberals show on television. It must be law that in election day the media must be forced to rigorously study the backgrounds of each candidates, and if the one of the election candidates see's that some information about them are lacking or is half told, that may damaged the fairness of the election, he may report this error and failure to comply by the media will result in some sort of punishment. In this method the citizens can rationaly think observed the stature of the man and make an intellectual decision in voting. They could pay the media to shut up about their illegal past dealings but they can never pay them to shut up about the good they've done, if ever they did anything good at all though.

Increase the availability of public transportation. This will reduce the *need* for cars, which will help households save on insurance and maintenance, which allows resources to go towards other wants. Plus, mass transit has a lower carbon footprint.

Ugj7SVI16gIxrngCoAEC,"Some notes if anyone needs em!

Economics systems are made when we figure out 
What to produce 
How to produce it 
Who gets it 
-2 current day economic systems are market economies and planned economies (which comes down to who owns and controls the factors of production) → Karl Marx classified these as Land, labour, and capital 
-Planned economies have government controlling the factors of production 
-Karl Marx summarized Communism as the abolition of private property → no country has ever been communist
-Socialist countries have a mix between private and sub-public ownership 
-Command economy = everything controlled by the government (including output) , which is opposite to a free market economy (or capitalism) where individuals own the factors of production, and government stays out of production, commerce, and trade → meaning businesses make things with the sole purpose of profit 
-Invisible hand of the market = the unintended social benefits resulting from individual actions → why companies that make shitty things go bankrupt 
-Government steps in in free markets to regulate production (to ensure proper standards of employment etc) and to maintain rules of law and provide public service like bridges and schools (things that won’t turn a profit) 
-Modern economies are a spectrum of planned and free economies with varying levels of government intervention (North Korea ←most countries→ New Zealand) 
-Circular flow model:
-Businesses sell goods through the product market to households 
-Households pay for goods by selling resources (labour) to business through the resource market 
-Government then steps in and helps regulate things by using taxes, and borrowing money
→ gets more complex with international relations, trade, and finance sector
-Your moral compass dictates what you believe is the appropriate level of government intervention, like providing a safety net for those with low incomes, or straying away from those who are in poor situations due to personal choices like drugs or gambling",B43YEW2FvDs

Ughz7_1P0x5gm3gCoAEC,"The Circular Flow Model [5:38] also explains what's going wrong in the American economy:

By raising prices while keeping wages stagnant, wealth accumulates in the hands of businesses while simultaneously creating a precarious environment for households, increasing competition in the resource market.  Especially once businesses are able to sell each-other automated systems and further reduce their need for labour.

Eventually, a small subset of business owners accumulate the vast majority of available wealth and use it to influence the government to _further_ tilt market conditions in their favour.  This exponentially increases inequality until not enough wealth remains in the system to provide enough demand to support the product market as a whole and the economy collapses.

Unfortunately, even if businesses were legally required to pay more for labour, it only creates an incentive to automate faster and more extensively.  Human labour is rapidly being priced out of the market.  And without jobs, households have no money to spend, thus destroying the circular flow.

Put another way, you could say that customers are becoming too expensive for businesses.",B43YEW2FvDs

No, Adriene... no it isn't a better shirt. On the other hand, it's not really worse either.

A really nice prison, of course... But you still might want Jacob (or maybe your camera man) to vette your shirts before going on.

But I have to tell ya (if you're still reading this after me being all mean like that) you sure know a lot about economics, thanks for your great work.  :*",B43YEW2FvDs
